# SACR-DCA
We propose a multi-omics clustering model called SACR-DCA for cancer subtype identification, which utilizes a dual-channel encoder, self-attention mechanism, and multiple loss functions for joint optimization, ultimately achieving superior clustering performance.

SACR-DCA is based on the Python program language. The network's implementation was based on the open-source library Pytorch 1.12.1+cu113. We used the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU for the model training. 
We recommend using PyCharm or VS Code as the development environment for running the code.
